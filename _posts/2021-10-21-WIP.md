<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
Projecting (and selecting) players for the NFL draft has become a <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/mock-draft/">year-round focus</a> for certain segments of the sport's fanbase. To gain insight into collegiate player's future performance, NFL executives, bloggers, and TV talking heads spend countless hours
<ul>
 <li>Reviewing tape</li>
 <li>Making assessments of things such as "Motor", "Heart", and "Grit"</li>
 <li>Asking players questions like "If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?</li>
 </ul>
 
 <br/>
 Which raises the question - when attempting to project a player's placement in the NFL draft, can we derive any insight out of something more quantifiable than an associate GM's hamfisted attempt at pop psychology?
 
 <br/><br/>
 In this essay, I use quantifiable performance data from the NFL Combine to see if we can better predict a player's selection round in the NFL draft.
 
 
<h3>II. Data and Data Wrangling</h3>
To begin this process, I collected NFL Combine performance data from <a href="https://nflcombineresults.com/">NFLCombineResults.com</a>, and collected draft history data from ESPN (example page <a href="http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/history/_/year/history?year=2020&round=-1&team=-1&college=-1&x=33&y=23&position=-1&procoach=-1&highschoolstate=-1&award=-1&collegecoach=-1&highschool=-1">here</a>).
 
<br/><br/>
The resulting datasets look like this:
<br/>
<b>NFL Combine Data:</b>

<br/><br/>
<b>NFL Draft Data:</b>
<img src="/assets/img/draft_data_5_rows.png">


<br/>
These datasets have the raw information we need, but we'll need to merge the datasets together to pair a given player's NFL Combine statistics with their ultimate draft selection. Maybe we can just join by player name? That would require that each player name is totally unique. Are they?
<br/><br/>
<pre><code class="python">
 df_combine['name'].value_counts(sort='descending').head(10)<br/>
 Out[7]<br/>
Brandon Williams    5<br/>
Chris Brown         5<br/>
Brian Allen         4<br/>
Mike Williams       4<br/>
Chris Jones         4<br/>
</code></pre>

<br/><br/>
Nope. So we'll need to join the datasets on both player name and college to ensure uniqueness. Are the college names identical between datasets? Let's merge the two datasets on their respective 'school' columns and see what matches up...<br/>
<pre><code>schools = draft_school.merge(combine_school, on='school', how='outer',
                             suffixes=['_draft', '_combine']).sort_values(by='school')</code></pre>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
So it's all a mess. Here are a few of the steps required to clean up the data:
<ul>
 <li>Remove the state indicator from school name in the "NFL Combine" dataset <br/>
  <pre>regex_replace_parens = r'\([^)]*[a-zA-Z][^)]*\)'
df_combine['school'] = df_combine['school'].str.replace(regex_replace_parens,
                                                        '', regex=True)</pre></li>
 <li>Remove "Jr./III/IV", etc. suffixes from player names from the "NFL Draft" dataset:<br/>
  <pre>regex_suffixes_to_remove = r'Jr\.$|III$|IIII$|IV$|, Jr.$'
df_draft['name'] = df_draft['name'].str.replace(regex_suffixes_to_remove,
                                                '', regex=True)</pre></li>
 <li>The "NFL Combine" dataset has 25 different position labels (like SS/Strong Safety). Remap these granular positions, and assign each position an indicator of [O]ffense or [D]efense, and an indicator of whether the position is a [S]kill position or a [L]ineman position.</li>
 </ul>
 
 
<br/><br/>
Now we've standardized the player and collegiate names in each dataset and can merge them together:<br/>
<pre><code>df_merged = df_combine.merge(df_draft, how='left',
                             on=['name', 'school', 'year'])

df_merged.head()</code><pre>

<h3>III. Statistical Methods</h3>
We now want to statistically validate the accuracy of ESPN's win probability.
